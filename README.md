# Assignment2_s333976

For assignment 2 in the course Introduction to Artificial Intelligence, I have chosen use case 1, the prediction of stock market prices for Norwegian airlines. For this use case, I believe regression would be the superior method to use. This is because stock market prices are continuous, which regression supports. I am attempting to predict an outcome variable, the stock price on a certain date which hasn't happened yet, based on a series of other variables, in this case earlier stock market prices. I also chose regression because, to be frank, that seems to be what all the other stock market prediction python tutorials use. The date I have chosen for my prediction is 16th of March 2021, just because that's my birthday. :-)
